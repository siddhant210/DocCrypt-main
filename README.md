## Problem Statement
Centralized platforms like Google Docs face:
- *Centralized Control:* Prone to breaches and lack of ownership.
- *Privacy Risks:* Metadata/content analyzed without consent.
- *Integrity Issues:* Mutable document history.
- *Scalability Challenges:* Limited access in low-connectivity regions.
- *No Cryptographic Guarantees:* Trust deficit.

---

## Objectives
- *Decentralized, trustless platform* for document management.
- Use *IPFS* for distributed storage.
- Implement *Aptos blockchain* for immutable record-keeping.
- Ensure *end-to-end privacy*, ownership, and integrity.
- Enable *real-time secure collaboration*.

---

## Key Features
- *AI Chatbot assisted Document Scanner:* An AI-driven chatbot leverages advanced text analysis to deliver precise, context-aware assistance and efficient query resolution for uploaded documents.
- *Decentralized Storage:* Documents stored on *IPFS* with content hash for integrity.
- *Immutable Audit Trails:* Blockchain-backed logs ensure authenticity.
- *Secure Collaboration:* Cryptographic signatures and timestamps.
- *User Ownership:* No third-party server dependency; full data control.
- *Event Management:* Real-time notifications and milestone tracking.

---

## Tech Stack
- *Web 3.0*: Peer-to-peer trustless network.
- *IPFS*: Content-based decentralized storage.
- *Aptos Blockchain*: Immutable metadata ledger.

## Advantages Over Google Docs
| *Feature*             | *Google Docs*                            | *Our App*                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| *Data Ownership*      | Centralized, owned by Google              | Decentralized, user-owned              |
| *Privacy*             | Metadata/content analyzed                 | Fully private, user-controlled         |
| *Audit Trails*        | Mutable, editable                        | Immutable, blockchain-backed           |
| *Integrity*           | No cryptographic guarantees               | Content hash verification (IPFS)       |
| *Censorship Resistance*| Prone to policy changes                 | Decentralized and censorship-resistant |
| *Global Accessibility*| Restricted in some regions               | IPFS nodes ensure global access        |
